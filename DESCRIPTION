Description: This package facilitates seamless calculation of the log-periodogram 
  for full continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data wear periods, providing reasonable
  setting defaults. These variance decompositions can then be used in the calculation 
  of a color spectrum metric, the GCI, which is a weighting of disjoint linear model
  parameters fit to the log-periodogram itself. The weighting here is derived 
  using a cohort of N=141 individuals with repeat CGM wears, a baseline and 
  3-month follow-up. This weighting is provided as a default within the package.

Description: This package facilitates calculation of the log-periodogram 
  for full continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data wear periods, providing reasonable
  defaults for estimation hyper-parameters. These variance decompositions can 
  then be used in the calculation of a color spectrum metric, the GCI, which is 
  a weighting of disjoint linear model parameters fit to the log-periodogram itself. 
  The weighting here is derived using a cohort of N=141 individuals with repeat 
  CGM wears, a baseline and 3-month follow-up. This weighting is provided as a 
  default within the package. Alternative, more integrated functionality for directly
  calculating GCI from vector or long-form dataframes, using the same defaults,
  is provided.

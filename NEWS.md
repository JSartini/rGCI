# rGCI 1.0.0

This is the first major release of this package. As you use it and encounter issues or thoughts for helpful additions, please feel free to submit GitHub issues/etc. We will address them as soon as we can with additional releases.

## Plans for potential future expansions

* More flexible CGM input formats for even more seamless use on raw CGM data

* More integration with the tidyverse (calculation within dataframes - vignettes, simplifications of existing procedures)
